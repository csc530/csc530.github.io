        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>below is a list of my technical skills, primarily <i>(because that's what I believe I can monetize and profit
                off of and employers look for)</i>, which I am apt to work with and understandüòÅ.</p>
        <ul :class="$style.flow">
            <li v-for="skill in skills" :key="skill.name">

        <p><small>There are many other languages frameworks, skills, and abilities that I don't list here because there
                icons aren't availble on <a href="https://simpleicons.org/" target="_blank">simpleicons.org</a> likely
                because of the company's licensing and trademark policies for their brandingüòí</small></p>

            title="no not experience because my-, scratch that,  &quot;experience&quot; is so much more than the hours logged at work: no matter how enormous or well-paid. Life is experience. And if you're life is summed up in your work history, then fine. But not so for me ‚Äî and I'm glad for it.">
            Jobs</h2>
        <p>I've been fortunate to work at jobs I really do enjoy and had even better colleagues who are loving and not
            deluded by work or status (<i>at least I hope they deluded not and genuinely prioritizing workplace prestige
                over humanity: respect, honesty, connection, and empathy primarily</i>)</p>
